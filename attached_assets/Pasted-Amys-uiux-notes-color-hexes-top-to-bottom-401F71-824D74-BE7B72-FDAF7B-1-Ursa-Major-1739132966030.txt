*There’s a formula for calculating angular distance between two stars (lmk if you guys want the formula)

Example Distances for Major Constellations (As Seen from the Moon)
Constellation
Angular Size (°)
Main Star Distance (ly)
Ursa Major (Big Dipper spans ~19°)
~19°
Dubhe: 123 ly, Merak: 79.7 ly
Orion (Belt spans ~4.5°)

How Far Can You See from the Moon?
Naked Eye Limit: Magnitude ~+6.5 (similar to Earth, but clearer without an atmosphere).
Telescope Limit: A small telescope on the Moon could see billions of light-years away due to no atmospheric distortion.
Hubble Deep Field Comparison: A lunar telescope could observe even fainter galaxies.
